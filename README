PSX4All Maemo Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a port of handheld PlayStation emulator psx4all to Linux for the
Maemo 5 distribution.

It features MIPS to ARM recompiling CPU emulation, and performance is
acceptable.

Sound works in principle, but slows down emulation considerably.

It is possible to run games with the integrated high-level BIOS emulation,
but compatibility is so-so. It is thus highly recommended to use
a PlayStation BIOS image, which psx4all expects to be situated in
/home/user and to be named "scph1001.bin" (lower case!).

psx4all is able to use PlayStation games in BIN format (2352 byte raw
sectors, file extension ".bin") and is also able to load files in the
compressed CBIN format (file extension ".cbn"), which is very similar to the
well-known CISO format, but uses a different sector size. A tool called
"cbin" is supplied with the emulator that is able to convert BIN format
images to CBN files. (Precompiled binaries are shipped for Mac OS X and
Linux/i386; the source code should be trivial to compile on whatever system
you are using; it only depends on zlib.) ISO images are moderately supported.

Memory cards are supported and need to be named mcd001.mcr and mcd002.mcr
for Slot 1 and Slot 2, respectively. If these files do not exist in
/home/user, psx4all will create them.
